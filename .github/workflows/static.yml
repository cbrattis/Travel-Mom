How this country mama saves on travel and makes memories with her boy
Hey y’all — I’m China, a restaurant-running mama who’s crazy about adventures with Elijah. I got tired of paying full price. This club gave me insider rates, points on bookings, and (if you want) a simple way to earn. More “let’s go!” and less “can we really afford it?”

Why I chose this
From “paying retail” to “pack the bags”
I love spoiling my boy with little getaways—ball games, beach days, you name it. With this travel & lifestyle club, I see insider pricing before I book, stack points for the next trip, and there’s even an optional ambassador plan that pays. It’s simple, mama-proof, and honestly the most doable thing I’ve tried.
	•	Insider rates on hotels, resorts, cruises & more
	•	Annual trip options that can offset membership
	•	Optional pay when friends join through you

FAQ
Questions I get a lot
Is this a timeshare?
No ma’am. No deeded property, no presentations, no locked-in week.
Can I join for savings only?
Absolutely. Plenty of members never share it and just enjoy insider pricing.
Do I have to sell?
No. Sharing is optional. If you do share, there’s a simple pay plan.
Hidden fees?
Membership pricing is transparent. You always see your rate before you book, and you can cancel any time.
